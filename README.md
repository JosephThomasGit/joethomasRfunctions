# joethomasRfunctions
An assortment of R functions I've written in one package. Current functions bin data and calculate moving averages and moving correlations. Install this package in R using devtools (more information in the readme file).

To install this package:

1. Open R or R Studio
2. Make sure you have devtools installed and required (if you don't install the packages with this: install.packages('devtools'); and require the package with this: library(devtools))
3. Install the 'joethomasRfunctions' packages with the code: devtools::install_github('joethomas-git/joethomasRfunctions')
4. Require the package using the code: library(joethomasRfunctions)

Tutorials for each of the functions are located on my main page (joethomas-git.github.io).
